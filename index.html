                    <li><span class="bold">1815 (December 10)</span>: Augusta Ada Byron (later known as Ada Lovelace) is born in London, England, to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1824</span>: Ada's parents separate, and her mother, Lady Byron, takes responsibility for her education. She emphasizes mathematics and science in Ada's upbringing, believing these subjects would prevent Ada from inheriting her father's poetic temperament.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1833</span>: Ada meets mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage at a party. This encounter marks the beginning of their collaborative relationship.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1835</span>: Ada marries William King, who becomes the Earl of Lovelace, and she becomes Ada King, Countess of Lovelace.
    
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1839</span>: Ada and Charles Babbage begin corresponding regularly. Babbage introduces her to his design for the Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer, and she becomes captivated by the idea.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1843</span>: Ada translates an article written by the Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea about Babbage's Analytical Engine. In the process, she adds extensive notes to the translation, including an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, which is considered the world's first computer program.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1843-1844</span>: Ada's notes, which are three times longer than Menabrea's article itself, are published alongside the translated work in an English journal called "Taylor's Scientific Memoirs."</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1844</span>: Ada's mother, Lady Byron, encourages her to continue working with Babbage and supports her intellectual pursuits.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1851</span>: Ada Lovelace becomes ill with uterine cancer, and her health begins to deteriorate.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1852 (November 27)</span>: Ada Lovelace dies in London at the age of 36.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1878</span>: Ada's work is republished in Richard Taylor's book "Scientific Memoirs." This republication helps revive interest in her contributions to computing.
    
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">20th Century</span>: Ada Lovelace's notes and work gain greater recognition, and she becomes known as the world's first computer programmer. The Ada programming language is named in her honor, reflecting her pioneering contributions to the field of computer science.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1st Century</span>2: Ada Lovelace's legacy continues to be celebrated, with events, books, and initiatives dedicated to her and her contributions to the world of programming and technology.</li>
